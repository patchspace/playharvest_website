{"name":"Harvest","tagline":"Harvest game online","body":"# Harvest\r\n\r\nVery early days!\r\n\r\n# What is Harvest?\r\n\r\nHarvest is a game that lets players see what it's like to run a business in the shared, limited resource of a fishing ground. Will players co-operate and fish sustainably, or go for short term profit and harvest the fish to extinction?\r\n\r\n# Why make Harvest online?\r\n\r\nThree reasons: fun, learningâ€¦ and profit.\r\n\r\n**Fun**: Harvest is simple but entertaining to play.\r\n\r\n**Learning**: I wanted to build an app with a small problem domain to experiment with [CQRS](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) and [Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) in Ruby. I also wanted to try building a rich-client browser app (I'll use [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)) against a simple API server (using [Webmachine](https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby)). This all makes it a big detour from The Rails Way, which means more work now, but will lead potentially to more powerful tools in future.\r\n\r\n**Profit**: The engine for Harvest could be used to build many other games and simulations. It could conceivably even be used to build management dashboard simulations. But these ideas are a long way off. Profit is not an immediate goal: this is an experiment first, a startup second.\r\n\r\n# Who\r\n\r\nHarvest is being written by [Ash Moran](https://github.com/ashmoran) of [PatchSpace Ltd](http://www.patchspace.co.uk/).
