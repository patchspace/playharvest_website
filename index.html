        <h1>Harvest</h1>

<p>Very early days!</p>

<h1>What?</h1>

<p>Harvest is a game that lets players see what it's like to run a business in the shared, limited resource of a fishing ground. Will players co-operate and fish sustainably, or go for short term profit and harvest the fish to extinction?</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>Three reasons: fun, learningâ€¦ and profit.</p>

<p><strong>Fun</strong>: Harvest is simple but entertaining to play.</p>

<p><strong>Learning</strong>: I wanted to build an app with a small problem domain to experiment with <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> and <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event Sourcing</a> in Ruby. I also wanted to try building a rich-client browser app (I'll use <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>) against a simple API server (using <a href="https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby">Webmachine</a>). This all makes it a big detour from The Rails Way, which means more work now, but will lead potentially to more powerful tools in future.</p>

<p><strong>Profit</strong>: The engine for Harvest could be used to build many other games and simulations. It could conceivably even be used to build management dashboard simulations. But these ideas are a long way off. Profit is not an immediate goal: this is an experiment first, a startup second.</p>
